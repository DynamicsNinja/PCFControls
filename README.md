# PCF-Controls

* IbanValidator
* SirentValidator
* SiretValidator 

### Purpose
In many projects, we need to implement custom logic to validate Account data such as the IBAN, the Siret and the Siren. In few clicks, you can now get the information directly on the form to know if the data is correct and get that information to a custom field.

There are 4 parameters for those controls :

* Source field : field on which the control will be based
* The Two options field to get the output (if the code is valid or not)
* The possibility to set your own Valid icon (url)
* The possibility to set your own Invalid icon (url)
